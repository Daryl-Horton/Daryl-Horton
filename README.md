# **Daryl** Horton

With over 14 years of experience writing long and short form operational documents, you could say I love writing. My experience includes:

- Designing and documenting operational processes
- Creating Standard Operating Procedures, User Guides, and Diagrams
- Developing documentation management systems using MS SharePoint
- Creative writing and desktop publishing using Scribus, Sigil, Calibre, Inkscape, Gimp, Krita, and many other open source applications
- Implementing information and knowledge management strategies

I love learning and I am currently learning how to leverage python programming for creative and writing projects. You can view examples of my creative work at www.daryl-horton.com

>I look forward to collaborating on projects in need of technical writing and python support.
